# Current native validation checkpoint

Validated source: `3591548efd593215cc54cd9c32272bd8491cb14e`.
The full published x64 sequence passes in **374.8848365 seconds** with all
**1,034 captures**. The full-suite watchdog is eight minutes; focused modes
retain six minutes. The additional 240 required chart pointer actions and
their presentation gates account for a larger workload. This is functional
verification, with no throughput-improvement claim. The original collection
performance requirements remain open and separate.

## Runtime evidence

Independent audits verify:

- All prior 1,034 capture names, with none missing.
- All 174 protected Sunburst/Radial glyph hashes unchanged.
- 1,972 pointer moves and presentation gates, zero failures and at least two
  genuine stable Rendering transitions. Maximum gate time is 181.8119 ms
  under the original two-second deadline. Eighty-eight stationary moves
  retain a preceding exact receipt; all 240 newly added chart moves require
  their own fresh genuine receipt.
- 1,738 owned key pairs and 62 physical clicks, with zero failures.
- All eighteen final presentation gates, twenty-eight Tooltip gates and
  118 Toolbar source cases.
- Both themes' Filter, Column Toggle and Pagination lifecycle checks,
  including controlled ownership, stale/disabled rejection and zero final
  observers. The keyed live-options checks remain verified.
- The separately audited 84 circular and 36 Sparkline cases retain every
  original keyboard expectation and their added source-defined hover/exit
  states.

Evidence is below `artifacts/`: `smoke-capture-boundary-validated-full`,
`capture-boundary-{prior-1034,full-preservation,full-native-input,full-aggregate,full-pie,full-sparkline}-audit.json`
and `capture-boundary-validated-full-timing.json`. The timing journal and its
summary retain the complete process rather than inferring a pass from image
count alone.

The earlier six-minute timeouts and intermittent Tooltip/Input failures
remain retained. The current full run passes those same assertions; it does
not establish the causes of the earlier intermittent failures. Input now
writes failure-only brush/state diagnostics. No expected color, native
cursor, source reference, comparison mask, per-state deadline or input
assertion was relaxed.

## Builds, consumer and image persistence

Clean x64 and ARM64 solution builds have zero warnings/errors; all 100 unit
tests and token generation pass. The fresh independent x64 NuGet consumer
passes both themes. Its Sparkline evidence verifies empty-data inspection
cleanup, restored original data and one owned Right down/up pair. The fresh
ARM64 consumer compiles, with runtime explicitly unverified. Both generated
consumer caches are removed, and the cleanup regression also proves cleanup
after invalid-project and restore failures.

The published `brush-alpha` mode verifies four frozen persistence cases:
transparent, odd dimensions, every alpha/channel pair and catalog size.
An independent decoder confirms exact PNG bytes and RGBA pixels, immediate
file completion and propagated write failure. That regression is registered
in both native CI jobs. Actions remain paused for pushes; no new hosted
runtime evidence is implied.

The bitmap-reuse, worker-encoding and direct-DIB experiments showed no
established performance benefit and were removed. Their measurements and
patches remain available; see [runtime diagnostics](catalog-readiness.md).
The public library and dependency source is unchanged from candidate
`ab2af53`, whose eleven focused modes and independent audits remain prior
evidence. The current full sequence, package consumer and persistence checks
above use the new source and artifacts.

## Deliverable bytes

All 532 published x64 files match the clean build. The catalog and both
consumers contain the same packaged library. ZIP audits verify every entry;
the ARM64 ZIP records build-only scope.

## Remaining acceptance

The inventory remains 53 in progress, 59 pending and zero accepted out of
112. Exact source raster/routes, complete motion and override matrices,
scaling, Windows contrast/Narrator, collection performance and current native
ARM64 runtime remain separate required work. The goal stays active. The
public wiki remains unavailable, so this checkpoint is documented here.
