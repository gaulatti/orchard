# Gaulatti.Orchard

Native Windows components and Bleecker theme resources for C# / WinUI 3.
The current 0.1.0 foundation provides typography, light/dark/contrast palettes,
button and icon-button components, connected button groups, toggle styles and
groups, loading spinners, cards, transient alerts, brand lockups and initial input styles. Full component parity is in progress.

Target .NET 10 and Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0. Use Windows App SDK 2.5.1.
Add the package from the directory containing the downloaded `.nupkg` or your
configured package feed:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Gaulatti.Orchard" Version="0.1.0" />
```

Merge resources in `App.xaml` in this order:

```xml
<ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    <XamlControlsResources xmlns="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls" />
    <ResourceDictionary Source="ms-appx:///Orchard/Themes/Orchard.xaml" />
</ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
```

Apply `BleeckerPrimaryButtonStyle`, `BleeckerSecondaryButtonStyle`,
`BleeckerHeadingStyle`, `BleeckerBodyStyle`, `BleeckerTextBoxStyle` or
`BleeckerComboBoxStyle`. Use `ThemeResource` for colors. The package copies fonts
and their SIL Open Font License texts to `Orchard/Assets/Fonts` in build and
publish output; no sibling source checkout or installed fonts are required.
Bleecker token attribution is included in `licenses/LICENSE-Bleecker.txt`.
The packaged brand SVG is copied to `Orchard/Assets/Images`. Brand filtering uses
the pinned transitive Win2D 1.4.0 dependency; keep its native runtime files with
the complete build/publish output.

Custom actions use the `using:Orchard` XAML namespace. `BleeckerButton` supports
variants, sizes, commands and loading. `BleeckerIconButton` supports three
variants and sizes and requires a consumer-supplied accessible name.
`BleeckerAlert` provides typed window-owned messages, duration and close callbacks;
`BleeckerAlertContainer.ShowAlert` publishes to containers in an explicit XAML root.
`BleeckerBrandLockup` preserves consumer-owned routes and commands, supports both
sizes, optional names, custom image sources and typed consumer link templates.
`BleeckerButtonGroup` connects native or Orchard buttons. See the repository's
[component documentation](https://github.com/gaulatti/orchard/blob/main/docs/parity.md)
for examples and the acceptance status of each component.

The application owns data, commands, navigation and network access. Catalog and
test code are not part of the library. Keep the complete unpackaged output
directory together when distributing an application.
